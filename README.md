The game will be a hacking game in which the player has to "hack" a system. The game itself will be rather basic 2D with black background green text for the hacker vibes. The unique twist in this hacking game is that the controller will consist of just five joysticks. The player will wear a wristband with the joysticks on and use the other hand to interact with the joysticks. This is to give the hacker feeling that the player is using a panel on wrist to hack. 

The game will work by the player having to move their fingers in a set combination to “hack” the system. It could also work in a similar way to lock picking in Skyrim but with five locks at once rather than just one. Play testing will take place to find which one fits the game more.
