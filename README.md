The game will be a hacking game in which the player has to "hack" a system. The game itself will be rather basic 2d with black background green text for the hacker vibes. The unique twist in this hacking game is that the controller will consist of just five joysticks. The player will wear a wrist band with the joysticks on and use the other hand to interact with the joysticks. This is to give the hacker feeling that the player is using a panel on wrist to hack with. 
It will work by the player having to move their fingers in a set combination or it will work in a similar way to lockpicking in skyrim, after play testing will see which one feels better.
